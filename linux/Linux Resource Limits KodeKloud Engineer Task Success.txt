Question : On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:

a. soft limit = 80

b. hard_limit = 92

Please Note:-  Perform the below commands based on your question server,  user name & other details that might differ as per the task.


Solution:  

1. At first login to one storage server  &  Switch to the root user 

thor@jump_host /$ ssh natasha@ststor01

[natasha@ststor01 ~]$ sudo su -


2.  Edit limit.conf file as below vi /etc/security/limits.conf

         (refer to you task for limits & add in the conf file)


[root@ststor01 ~]# vi /etc/security/limits.conf


[root@ststor01 ~]# cat /etc/security/limits.conf | grep nproc | grep -v ^#

nfsuser         soft    nproc   80

nfsuser         hard    nproc   92
