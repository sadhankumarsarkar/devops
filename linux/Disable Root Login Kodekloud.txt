Solution:

You need to disable root login in all appservers. So login to appserver 1 at first 

ssh tony@stapp01

sudo su

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Press I button

Uncomment by removing # in PermtiRootLogin and replace yes with no

PermtiRootLogin no

Save it by :wq!

Then restart sshd by typing

service sshd restart

Next go to appserver 02 and appserver 03 and do the same thing like appserver 01
