Question:
For some security reasons xFusionCorp Industries security team has decided to use custom Apache users for each web application hosted there rather than its default user. Since this is going to be the Apache user so it shouldnâ€™t use the default home directory. Create the user as per requirements given below:

a. Create a user named ravi on the App server 1 in Stratos Datacenter.

b. Set UID to 1264 and its home directory to /var/www/ravi

 

Solution: 

ssh tony@stapp01

sudo su -


useradd ravi -d /var/www/ravi -u 1264

cat /etc/passwd | grep ravi
