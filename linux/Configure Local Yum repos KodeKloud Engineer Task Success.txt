Question :  The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.

a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.

b. Create a yum repo named local_yum and make sure to set Repository ID to local_yum. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package httpd from this newly created repo.

Please Note :-  Perform the below commands based on your question server,  user name & other details that might differ. So please read the task carefully before executing it. All the Best 👍


Solution:  

1. At first login on Backup server  & Switch to  root user

thor@jump_host ~$ ssh clint@stbkp01

[clint@stbkp01 ~]$ sudo su -


2. Run the Below command to   check is there  already any yum repository is available     

[root@stbkp01 ~]# yum repolist   

Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, ovl

Determining fastest mirrors

repolist: 0



 3. Since there is no repo you need to create local repo  as per the task

[root@stbkp01 ~]# vi /etc/yum.repos.d/local_yum.repo

[root@stbkp01 ~]# cat /etc/yum.repos.d/local_yum.repo

[local_yum]

name=local_yum

baseurl=file:///packages/downloaded_rpms/

enabled = 1

gpgcheck = 0




4. After the file is saved, check to create repo listed 

[root@stbkp01 yum.repos.d]# yum repolist

Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, ovl

local_yum                                                                                                           | 2.9 kB  00:00:00    

local_yum/primary_db                                                                                                |  57 kB  00:00:00    

repo id                                                           repo name                                                          status

local_yum                                                         local_yum                                                          55

repolist: 55




5. As per the task install package  (I have installed httpd using this repo )

[root@stbkp01 yum.repos.d]# yum install httpd
