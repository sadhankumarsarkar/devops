Question :  The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. Therefore, perform the steps below:

a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.

b. Add a cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.


Solution:  
1. At first login to all App server  & Switch to  root user


thor@jump_host ~$ ssh tony@stapp01

[tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo su -

2. Install cronie package on server 

[root@stapp01 ~]# yum install cronie -y


3.  Start cron service & check the  status 

[root@stapp01 ~]# systemctl start crond.service

[root@stapp01 ~]# systemctl status crond.service


4.  Create a cronjob  as per the task for root user
    
[root@stapp01 ~]# crontab -e

no crontab for root - using an empty one

crontab: installing new crontab

 
5.  Check cron job for user root

[root@stapp01 ~]# crontab -l

*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text




6.  Validate  cron_text file is created successfully, before that done finish the task

[root@stapp01 ~]# ll /tmp/

total 8

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6 Jun 23 09:55 cron_text

-rwx------ 1 root root 836 Aug  1  2019 ks-script-rnBCJB

-rw------- 1 root root   0 Aug  1  2019 yum.log



Please Note :- Showed only for stapp01 have to do this in all app server stapp01,stapp02, stapp03.
