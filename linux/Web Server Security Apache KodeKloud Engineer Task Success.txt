Question :  During a recent security audit, the application security team of xFusionCorp Industries found security issues with the Apache web server on Nautilus App Server 1 server in Stratos DC. They have listed several security issues that need to be fixed on this server. Please apply the security settings below:

a. On Nautilus App Server 1 it was identified that the Apache web server is exposing the version number. Ensure this server has the appropriate settings to hide the version number of the Apache web server.

b. There is a website hosted under /var/www/html/media on App Server 1. It was detected that the directory /media lists all of its contents while browsing the URL. Disable the directory browser listing in Apache config.

c. Also make sure to restart the Apache service after making the changes.

Please Note:-  Perform the below commands based on your question server,  user name & other details that might differ. So please read the task carefully before executing it. All the Best üëç



Solution:  

1. At first login on app server  & Switch to root user 

thor@jump_host ~$ ssh tony@stapp01

[tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo su -


2. Run the Below command to check the existing Apache HTTPd service status     

[root@stapp01 ~]# systemctl status httpd

‚óè httpd.service - The Apache HTTP Server

   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/httpd.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)

   Active: inactive (dead)

     Docs: man:httpd(8)

           man:apachectl(8)



4. Confirm the existing config

[root@stapp01 ~]# cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  |grep ServerTokens



[root@stapp01 ~]# cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  |grep ServerSignature



[root@stapp01 ~]# cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  |grep Indexes

    #   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews

    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks



5. Edit the  /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  file and Added below lines end of config file & Save it

Also Modified Options  +FollowSymLinks ( go through video for more details)

[root@stapp01 ~]# vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf



[root@stapp01 ~]# cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  |grep ServerTokens

ServerTokens Prod

[root@stapp01 ~]# cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  |grep ServerSignature

ServerSignature Off

[root@stapp01 ~]# cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  |grep Indexes

    #   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews



6. Post saved config file, start the httpd services

[root@stapp01 ~]# systemctl start httpd

[root@stapp01 ~]# systemctl status httpd
