Question :  The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed intermittent issues with DNS resolution in several apps . App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues, so we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.
As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS (ipv4). Please make appropriate changes on this server.
Please Note :-  Perform the below commands based on your question  server,  user name & other details might differ . So please read task carefully before executing. All the Best üëç


Solution:  

1. At first login to app server  & Switch to  root user 

thor@jump_host ~$ ssh banner@stapp03

[banner@stapp03 ~]$ sudo su -

[root@stapp03 ~]#


3.  Verify the existing  resolve.conf file  

[root@stapp03 ~]# cat /etc/resolv.conf

search stratos.xfusioncorp.com

nameserver 127.0.0.11

options ndots:0



4.  Edit the  resolv.conf  file and add public DNS 8.8.8.8 as per task.

[root@stapp03 ~]# vi /etc/resolv.conf

[root@stapp03 ~]# cat /etc/resolv.conf

search stratos.xfusioncorp.com

nameserver 127.0.0.11

nameserver 8.8.8.8

options ndots:0
